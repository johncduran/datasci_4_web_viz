#What I learned:


I did run into multiple issues when running through posit.


##Coding
Since I am not used to using R I had trouble with seeing the syntax differences when it came to quoting certain lines.


I also had an issue following the documentation of trying to publish/deploy my app. It wasn't clear where to run the lines of code exactly. For instance, whether or not to run the rsconnect command in the console, terminal or in the actual .r file. After trying all of them and following some videos online I finally figured it out.


Then once it came to deploying it I just couldn't get it to launch. I could get it to run locally, but not outside of my environment. After following many videos and revising my code many times I figured out that I could just click on the blue publish button on the file and publish it through shiny.io. This let me finally get the url: https://stp9u6-john-duran.shinyapps.io/project/




##Interactivity
I tried to launch/deploy using the Python instructions in the documentation and using Goggle Shell, but this was not working at all. It worked by having it identify my account and seeing my token and secret, but it still ran into issues accessing my directory. It kept saying that I didn't have permission even though I gave it permission. I might have been doing something wrong, but in this case, the interactivity was okay.


##User Experience
The user experience of using posit was not very intuitive. It looks very dated, and the characters all around the UI are quite small. Having the .r file, environment, console and files windows open at the same time while using posit was a bit overwhelming since there were too many options available to me at the same time.
