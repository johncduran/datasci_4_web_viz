#What I learned:


This was the hardest option to create and deploy an app out of all of them. In the end after many hours of trying different code, watching videos, reading forums and more I couldn't get my app to launch or display my graph.


##Coding
I ran into many error codes such as the port being used by another application. In this case I changed it from 8000 to 8080 and vice versa when I ran into other issues. Then more issues would come up like it displaying the website since i used some code from the azure assignment before. That worked, but once I tried to put in the graph it would not want to work anymore. I revised and deleted my code many times and just couldn't figure out what was wrong. In this end I was able to launch my site again, but it only displays a photo icon on the top left with a white background everywhere else. I also was able to make it create a .png in the folder of the graph. 


##Interactivity
Since I am still not used to using matplotlib very well I did run into issues of getting certain commands to work. I had some issues of getting the app.py to register the .html file. I also realized that I did need a requirement.txt file to get certain functions to work. 


##User Experience
I was using google colab at first, but then later switched to google shell since the UX/UI of it is better to me to understand and more flexible.
