#What I learned:


This was the smoothest experince out of R and matplotlib


##Coding
Since I was already used to using pandas I knew how to get it to read the file and to create a graph using it. I ran into some issues, but i resolved them all. Deployment was also doable as I ran it locally through google shell.



##Interactivity
There weren't any connection issues I ran into. The only issues in terms of interactivity were installing packages as I would forget to install some like dash.


##User Experience
Using google colab and then transfering my code to google shell was seemless. The UX was great and I didn't have any issues.
